# time_series_lstm

Time Series forecasting can be thought of as a Regression problem where we predict future value based on previous Sequence of values .
Whenever Sequence comes into consideration , LSTM are the most suited architecture on any given day .

In this post, we will learn how to develop LSTM networks in Python using the Keras and TensorFlow library to solve our time-series Forecasting problem.

There are generally 3 types of forecasting methods.

Univariate Time Series Forecasting Using LSTM
Multi Variate and SIngle Step Forecasting Using LSTM
MultiVariate Multi Step Forecasting Using LSTM

You will 3 ipython notebooks for each method .
also you learn more about this on my blog https://aboutdatascience.in
